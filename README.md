# WETCAT Librarian - A Chaotic Library Management Game

WETCAT Librarian is a fast-paced arcade game where you play as a dedicated librarian trying to maintain order in a library overrun by mischievous kids. Built with Web3 integration and World ID verification for unique rewards and fair play.

## Game Overview

In WETCAT Librarian, you must:
- Collect books (coins) scattered throughout the library
- Return them to their proper shelves
- Stop kids from stealing books and causing chaos
- Maintain order before the chaos level reaches critical mass
- Survive for 30 minutes to claim your daily rewards

## How to Play

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys/WASD**: Move your librarian character
- **Shift**: Sprint (consumes stamina)
- **Space**: Pick up books automatically when near them
- **P/Escape**: Pause the game

### Game Mechanics

#### Objective
Keep the library's chaos level below 100% by collecting and shelving books while preventing kids from stealing them.

#### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Collect Books**: Walk over coins (books) to pick them up (max 5 at a time)
2. **Return to Shelves**: Bring books to bookshelves to reduce chaos
3. **Repel Kids**: Get close to kids to make them flee and drop stolen books
4. **Manage Stamina**: Sprint strategically - stamina depletes quickly!

#### Scoring System
- Collecting a book: 10 points
- Shelving a book: 20 points + chaos reduction
- Repelling a kid: 5 points
- Time bonus: 10 points per minute survived

#### Chaos System
- Chaos increases when kids hold books (3% per second per kid)
- Chaos decreases when you shelf books (5% per book)
- Game ends if chaos reaches 100%

#### Wave System
- New waves of kids spawn every 30 seconds
- Each wave increases in difficulty
- Later waves spawn more aggressive kids

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or deploy to any static hosting
# Upload contents of dist/ folder
```

### Backend Deployment

The game server (`server/gameServer.js`) should be deployed to a Node.js hosting service:

```bash
# Install production dependencies
npm install --production

# Start server
node server/gameServer.js
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to testnet
npm run deploy:contracts

# Verify contracts
npm run verify:contract
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Write tests for your changes
4. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`

## Security Considerations

- Never share your private keys or JWT secrets
- Always verify smart contract addresses
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting on backend endpoints
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Regular security audits for smart contracts
